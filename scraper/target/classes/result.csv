Apple,"Apples are a common Food that can be eaten either raw, Roasted, or in a Stew. When chopped, one apple produces four apple slices. If the hunger value of these four cores is added together, the apple grants the most hunger satisfaction (slightly under two full bars) of any raw ingredient. It is important to note, that the apple ``must`` be sliced. A full apple does not satisfy as much hunger as four slices, despite the rational assumption that it would.","/Users/jiyuqi/Documents/GitHub/TownshipTaleWikiWebScraper/TownshipTaleWikiWebScraper/scraper/src/main/imagesApple.png"
